1. Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6.

2. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then return three times of their sum hint: write User defined functions

3. Write a Python program to count the number 4 in a given list.

List = [1,4,6,8,4,9,4]

4. Write a Python program to print all even numbers from a given numbers list in the same order and stop the printing if any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence. Go to the editorSample numbers list :

399, 162, 758, 219, 918, 237, 412, 566, 826, 248, 866, 950, 626, 949, 687, 217,

815, 67, 104, 58, 512, 24, 892, 894, 767, 553, 81, 379, 843, 831, 445, 742, 717,

958,743, 527]

5. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included)

6. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.

Note : Use 'continue' statement.

Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

7. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.

Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

8. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.

Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

9. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]

Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
